<h2>An article: Why the sky is blue.</h2>
<p>
  Have you ever wondered why the sky appears blue on a clear day? The answer lies in the way our atmosphere interacts with sunlight.

Sunlight is composed of a spectrum of colors, including red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. These colors have different wavelengths, with red having the longest wavelength and violet having the shortest.

As sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it collides with molecules and particles present in the air. The molecules in the atmosphere, particularly nitrogen and oxygen, scatter sunlight in all directions. However, the shorter blue and violet wavelengths of light are scattered more effectively than the other colors due to their shorter wavelengths and higher energy.

This scattering phenomenon, known as Rayleigh scattering, causes the blue light to scatter in all directions and dominate the sky's color. As a result, when we look up during the day, we see a vast expanse of blue sky.

Interestingly, during sunrise and sunset, the sky often takes on shades of red, orange, and pink. This occurs because the sunlight must pass through a thicker layer of the atmosphere when it's near the horizon. As a result, the shorter blue and violet wavelengths are scattered out of our line of sight, leaving the longer wavelengths like red and orange to dominate the sky's color palette.

In conclusion, the blue color of the sky is a result of sunlight scattering off molecules in Earth's atmosphere. Understanding this phenomenon not only adds to our appreciation of the natural world but also serves as a fascinating example of how light and matter interact in our everyday surroundings.
