<h2>An article: Why the sky is blue.</h2>
<p>
  Have you ever wondered why the sky appears blue on a clear day? The answer lies in the way our atmosphere interacts with sunlight.

Sunlight is composed of a spectrum of colors, including red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. These colors have different wavelengths, with red having the longest wavelength and violet having the shortest.

As sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it collides with molecules and particles present in the air. The molecules in the atmosphere, particularly nitrogen and oxygen, scatter sunlight in all directions. However, the shorter blue and violet wavelengths of light are scattered more effectively than the other colors due to their shorter wavelengths and higher energy.

This scattering phenomenon, known as Rayleigh scattering, causes the blue light to scatter in all directions and dominate the sky's color. As a result, when we look up during the day, we see a vast expanse of blue sky.

Interestingly, during sunrise and sunset, the sky often takes on shades of red, orange, and pink. This occurs because the sunlight must pass through a thicker layer of the atmosphere when it's near the horizon. As a result, the shorter blue and violet wavelengths are scattered out of our line of sight, leaving the longer wavelengths like red and orange to dominate the sky's color palette.

In conclusion, the blue color of the sky is a result of sunlight scattering off molecules in Earth's atmosphere. Understanding this phenomenon not only adds to our appreciation of the natural world but also serves as a fascinating example of how light and matter interact in our everyday surroundings.

<h2>All About HAX PSU!</h2>
<p>HAX is a radically simple way to create , share , and remix web content. The goal of HAX is simple: to help people create rich and engaging web content without, needing, to understand web code.
  In the 90's, when the web really caught on, it was difficult to design and develop web content, but it was easy to maintain and anyone could participate with minor technical ability. As tools have evolved, the web became a feature rich, design centric place that we know and use today but the complexity curve went way up to achieve that.
  HAX seeks to bring the web to the level of sustainability of the 90's web but without technical barriers to participate. It does this by encapsulating complexity using modern tools, yet saving everything in a portable, human readable format. As evidence, this website is built using HAX and is entirely static content that could be downloaded as a single zip file and moved easily.
  Headless is a common phrase in modern front-end web development. Without getting too technical up front, imagine that traditional web solutions are built as a single location solution. They require things you see on your screen right now but also are highly tied to "back-end" software that makes the experience work for you.
Headless means that the focus of HAX is on the front-end web user experience only. It has very little if any tie to a "back-end". This design constraint forces the development community to build the tool in such a way that it's highly portable to any environment, fast, small, and easy to maintain. The focus of HAX is on the author, specifically, content authors. Traditional Content management system (CMS) environments focus on management of content. The organization, storage, retrieval, and presentation of material are paramount to the way in which authors actually work with the solution.
By focusing on authors directly we are able to craft solutions that better meet the needs of users that know how to open up a text editor and start writing. HAX blocks and editing tools are engineered to empower authors because the management and storage of material are semantic, simple, and portable.
